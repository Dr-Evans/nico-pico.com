Hi there! I‚Äôm **Nico** and I'm from the United States. I graduated from the University of Florida in 2015 with a degree in Computer Engineering. Afterwards, I moved across the country to work at a large west coast tech company.

In mid-2021, I quit my well-paying software gig to travel, pursue some passion projects, and live life. [I talk about this a lot in my blog]({{< ref "/post/why-I-quit-my-six-figure-software-job" >}}).

The name of this website comes from my first name and my interest in photography (Nico + picture = **NICO ‚Ä¢ PICO**).

# What I like‚Ä¶
