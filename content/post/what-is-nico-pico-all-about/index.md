Hello there fellow internet traveler! ðŸ‘‹

My name is **Nico** and let me be the first to welcome you to my new website, **NICO â€¢ PICO**.

Iâ€™m a software developer who recently stepped away from his high-paying job to travel, pursue some passion projects, and live life. I plan on writing a lot about my feelings and learnings on this in my future blog posts.

## Idea Origins

The idea of **NICO â€¢ PICO** came to me after reaching out to a friend of mine who I hadnâ€™t seen in a while. I asked if he wanted to join my girlfriend and me on a day trip to go pumpkin picking with the intent of catching up. He responded he didnâ€™t have an interest in going as he was busy focusing on a new personal project of his â€” writing. He also conveyed that he was re-prioritizing his time and activities to achieve certain goals he had; and spending a valuable weekend day going pumpkin picking didnâ€™t fit with that.

Something about our discussion was very inspiring and made me realize how writing can be a therapeutic vector to collect, focus, and share ideas. In the past Iâ€™ve toyed with maintaining a journal for some personal reflection, but close friends gave me feedback that my musings might prove helpful to someone else out there. I also like the idea of contributing back to the internet in a meaningful way. With that, **NICO â€¢ PICO** was born!

## Hello World!

Iâ€™d like to use this platform to:

- Distill why I left my software development job
- Discuss my feelings on tech, lifestyle, photography, and culture
- Share some useful advice Iâ€™ve gathered along the way

I hope you, dear reader, find some information on this website inspiring and insightful. Expect more content weekly; and welcome to **NICO â€¢ PICO**!
