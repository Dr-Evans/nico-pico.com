&lt;p>A couple of years ago, I went out to grab drinks with a close friend of mine named &lt;strong>Miguel&lt;/strong>. He and I were friends from college who ended up working as software developers for the same company post-graduation. He had just been promoted to a senior position, something I was proud but slightly envious of, and we got on the topic of life and ambitions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;&lt;strong>Nico&lt;/strong>&amp;rdquo;, he confided in me, “I have this dream of stepping away from it all and working on a farm for a bit. Y’know, do something more down to earth. Software development is cool and all but I want to do something more tangible for a time.” &lt;strong>Miguel&lt;/strong> peered off in the distance, as if imagining it for himself.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I took a sip of my beer and nodded. I had just transferred to a new division within the company and wasn&amp;rsquo;t looking to make any drastic life changes myself. I had some gripes about my previous position and was optimistic about my new one. But I could sympathize with his perspective.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“Well, I hope you get to realize that dream. Maybe I’ll do the same some day.”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ever since that conversation, &lt;em>Miguel&lt;/em>&amp;rsquo;s dream had stuck with me. Over the years, I too caught myself having a drink with a friend, peering off in the distance, and imagining myself chopping imaginary wood or tending to an imaginary garden.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It wasn’t until a few years later that I was introduced to a program called &lt;a class="link" href="https://wwoof.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>WWOOF&lt;/a>. And it was soon after that I found myself chopping non-imaginary wood and tending to a non-imaginary garden in the mountains of North California.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="wait-whats-a-wwoof-">Wait, what’s a WWOOF? 🐶&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>WWOOF&lt;/strong> stands for &lt;strong>W&lt;/strong>orld &lt;strong>W&lt;/strong>ide &lt;strong>O&lt;/strong>pportunities on &lt;strong>O&lt;/strong>rganic &lt;strong>F&lt;/strong>arms. It’s a &lt;a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homestay" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>homestay program&lt;/a> geared to individuals with an interest in farming, gardening, homesteading, and other agriculture-related disciplines. It also has a secondary goal of promoting cultural and educational exchange.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>WWOOFing&lt;/strong> is unique in that there is no exchange of money. Instead, the host provides free food and lodging in exchange for work around the farm (the expectation is around 20 hours a week). This makes it a convenient option for budget travelers or those looking to garner experience without any upfront cost. Or people like me, who just want to do something different.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are also no binding contracts: &lt;strong>WWOOF&lt;/strong> is simply a platform to match volunteers (“&lt;strong>WWOOFers&lt;/strong>“) with hosts. If you find the hosts or accommodations or work disagreeable, you can simply leave. The platform operates on a review system where &lt;strong>WWOOFers&lt;/strong> and hosts can rate each other, so this tends not to happen too often.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Due to a sudden change of plans, I found myself with two weeks free around Thanksgiving. I took this as an opportunity to make my dream a reality. I signed up for &lt;strong>&lt;a class="link" href="https://wwoofusa.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>WWOOF USA&lt;/a>&lt;/strong> and searched for hosts with immediate availability.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Enter &lt;strong>Jim and Sharon Lieberman&lt;/strong>, affectionately known as…&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-liebys">The Lieby’s&lt;/h2>
&lt;figure>&lt;img src="liebys.webp"/>&lt;figcaption>
&lt;h4>Jim and Sharon Lieberman, aka The Lieby’s&lt;/h4>
&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>My initial correspondence with the &lt;strong>Lieby’s&lt;/strong> started with a questionnaire. I wrote them a long-winded response detailing who I was, &lt;a class="link" href="https://nico-pico.com/p/why-i-quit-my-six-figure-software-job/" title="how I recently quit my job as a software"
>how I recently quit my job as a software developer&lt;/a>, and how I was new to &lt;strong>WWOOFing&lt;/strong> but eager to learn.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Jim&lt;/strong> had this to say:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Dear &lt;strong>Nico&lt;/strong>,&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This all looks good. I was talking with a friend the other day as we handed out food to poor folks at the local food pantry, both complaining about programmers and capitalists and you looked like both! We want to hang programmers up by their toes and do all kinda nasty things back to them! You sound great, though!`&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Hah! I could tell we were going to get along.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Seriously, I like what you say here and hope we can supply what you are looking for. Mostly, we’ll be cutting and stacking firewood, maybe a little garden work. &lt;strong>Jian&lt;/strong>, a Korean woman around your age, will be starting her WWOOFing stint the week before.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>I appreciated his willingness to take me on with such short notice. I also appreciated I would have a fellow &lt;strong>WWOOFer&lt;/strong> present. This sounded like the perfect foray into &lt;strong>WWOOFing&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Unexpectedly, &lt;strong>Jim&lt;/strong> finished with the following note:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>You said you’re new to guitar? Bring it. I’d be happy to give you some lessons, if you like.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>And so it was with that I set off to California, guitar safely tucked in the back seat of my car.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="arrival">Arrival&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I pulled into &lt;strong>Jim&lt;/strong> and &lt;strong>Sharon&lt;/strong>’s homestead in the late afternoon after two days of driving. The ridge surrounding the property blocked the winter sun, giving the appearance that it was almost nighttime. An elderly man in worn jeans and a hoodie stepped out of the woodshed to greet me.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“You must be &lt;strong>Nico&lt;/strong>. Nice to meet you.”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“You must be &lt;strong>Jim&lt;/strong>. Nice to meet you too.”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Jim&lt;/strong> let out an outstretched hand, and I met it with a firm handshake. His hand was calloused and grooved, tempered by decades of work outside. A worker’s hand.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“Glad you made it. We were worried you had gotten lost.”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Indeed, I had been lost. I was almost an hour late and the sun set fast here in the mountains. I had been without signal for the past two hours and my GPS had taken me to the wrong location.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Luckily &lt;strong>Jim&lt;/strong> anticipated this, and in our correspondence had attached detailed directions to his homestead from the highway. I was able to use this information to go back to the main road and find my way. This would serve as an introduction to a lesson &lt;strong>Jim&lt;/strong> and &lt;strong>Sharon&lt;/strong> would echo throughout my stay: &lt;em>never trust technology over your own wits.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“Are you hungry? &lt;strong>Sharon&lt;/strong> and &lt;strong>Jian&lt;/strong> are inside making dinner. I’ll show you around tomorrow morning.”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Jim&lt;/strong> showed me to the main cabin. He opened the door and made his way to his favorite spot in the house: his dining room chair.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>&lt;img src="cabin.webp"/>&lt;figcaption>
&lt;h4>A view of the kitchen and dining room in the main cabin. Jim’s favorite chair pictured farthest.&lt;/h4>
&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Sharon&lt;/strong> stood perched over the stove top, tending to a chicken pesto she was making. She looked up, wooden spoon in hand, smile on her face.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“Welcome &lt;strong>Nico&lt;/strong>! Make yourself comfortable. Dinner will be ready soon.”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>She motioned to &lt;strong>Jian&lt;/strong>, who had just finished setting the table. She and I made eye contact.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“And this is &lt;strong>Jian&lt;/strong>. She arrived right before Thanksgiving. Her English is intermediate level, but she is improving a lot.”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Jian&lt;/strong> greeted me with a gentle smile. Anticipating this meeting, I took this as an opportunity to bust out the only Korean I knew.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“Annyeonghaseyo. Jeoneun Nico-ibnida.”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“발음이 좋으시네요, 한국어 하세요??”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“Uh…”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Jim&lt;/strong> and &lt;strong>Sharon&lt;/strong> got a kick out of this. I’d later find out that &lt;strong>Jian&lt;/strong> was the first Korean &lt;strong>WWOOFer&lt;/strong> they had hosted, so they weren&amp;rsquo;t used to hearing Korean. I also imagined they laughed at my American arrogance, thinking I could make a splash with rudimentary Korean.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“Your pronunciation is good,” &lt;strong>Jian&lt;/strong> said in clear English. “Where did you learn Korean?”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I explained that I had visited Korea two years ago. But I admitted I didn&amp;rsquo;t learn a lot of Korean because, like her, many of the Koreans I met spoke great English.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“Dinner’s ready!” &lt;strong>Sharon&lt;/strong> announced to the group. Not a dull moment in this household.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We all sat down. &lt;strong>Jim&lt;/strong> and &lt;strong>Sharon&lt;/strong> put their hands together, bowed their heads, and started saying gra– ah who am I kidding, my hosts were devout atheists who had no patience for such rituals.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Jim&lt;/strong> eyed me playfully. “So &lt;strong>Nico&lt;/strong>, have I ever told you how I hate programmers?”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And thus began the first dinner of many that went late into the night, fueled by good food, good wine, and good conversation.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>My parents thought I was crazy. “&lt;strong>Nico&lt;/strong>“, they told me, “why would you leave a job like this? You worked so hard to get it. You only work forty hours a week. You’re not out working the fields or standing on your feet all day. Many people dream of this!”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“Mom, Dad, I was unhappy there.”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>~ I was unhappy there.~&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What a silly thought. But it’s the core truth: I was unhappy with what I did and who I had become.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In this blog post, I’d like to express the core reasons why I was unhappy at, and ultimately left, my job.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="i-left">I left…&lt;/h2>
&lt;h3 id="-because-what-i-was-working-on-didnt-resonate-with-me">&amp;hellip; because what I was working on didn’t resonate with me.&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>A little background: I worked within the Monetization organization of my previous company. The north star of our organization was to develop revenue-generating features within our core product to make our content creators and company money (emphasis on the latter).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As you might guess, our core metric centered around money.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As you might guess, this was a shit metric to be judged by.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Admittedly, there were a lot of other factors I was individually judged on as a software developer – technical complexity, scope of influence, and the like.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But at the macro-level it was all about the money to measure your impact. And as you grow in your career, you start to become more privy to these macro-level expectations.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As a result, I developed a deep disinterest with my work.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A little rant:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>A teacher teaches the next generation of children. They have a tangible, positive impact on society.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A construction worker builds a home for a family or a bridge for a town. They have a tangible, positive impact on society.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Your local coffee shop offers a meaningful space for work and conversation. They have a tangible, positive impact on society.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>… and here I was enabling people with poor spending habits the ability to spend ridiculous amounts of money on virtual goods.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At the end of the day, my work was very unfulfilling.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="-because-i-wasnt-excelling-at-what-i-was-doing">&amp;hellip; because I wasn’t excelling at what I was doing.&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>This was a slow burn problem that crept up on me. At a certain point in my career, I had hit a wall with the throughput and quality of my work where I was doing ok, but I wasn’t excelling.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As a student in college, I worked my ass off. But while the classes were difficult, I somehow managed to stay on top of the curriculum. It was a virtuous cycle; I put the effort in and the results were immediate and positive, thus pushing me to continue to put the effort in, thus resulting in results that were immediate and positive, and so on.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As a junior developer, I had the same virtuous cycle. My management handed me appropriately-leveled tasks that I excelled in completing. I received feedback that was immediate and positive (both in reviews and compensation). Ultimately, this lead me to a fast track to promotion.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I went in as a mid-level developer with great prospects, but as the work became more challenging and ambiguous, my throughput tampered out. The impact of my work became less immediate and more fuzzy. Somewhere along the way I lost the virtuous cycle. And it filled me with dread.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Moreover, I watched as some of my peers continued to excel, grow in their careers, and get promoted. And it filled me with contempt.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After a lot of reflection, I realized something: I had hit the “natural limits” of my ability as a software developer. In order to grow at this point, I would have to either:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>flare my existing abilities (effortful)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>mold myself into a different kind of developer (unnatural)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>The first point seems pretty self-explanatory. I already put in a solid forty hours each week. I didn’t want to put more effort into my work at the expense of my personal life. If anything, I wanted to lower it. The second warrants more investigation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The company I worked for had a set of tenants that served as the basis for how employees were judged. There were about ten of them, and exemplifying these tenants were vitally important to your growth and success there.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It was easy enough for me to meet certain qualities for a seasoned developer, but some of them didn’t come to me as easily. And it wasn’t because I was lazy or incapable of growth, but because it meant adhering to a work philosophy that felt unnatural to who I was.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The result of all this is I stopped receiving glowing reviews, which hurt my encouragement to work hard. I slumped into being an ok developer in the eyes of those around me.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I ultimately came to the conclusion that I was graded against a rubric I didn’t believe in. My company wanted to grow me, but they wanted to grow me in a specific way that didn’t match what I wanted. It was simply unnatural for me. I didn’t want to drink the Kool-Aid and be groomed into someone that wasn’t me.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This resulted in me hitting a plateau in my professional growth that caused me much unhappiness.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="-because-i-wanted-a-different-environment">&amp;hellip; because I wanted a different environment.&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Your environment rubs off on you. Much like what you eat affects your wellbeing, so to can the environment you surround yourself with. After a while, I realized that I was at my limit with what I could stomach in the tech environment in many ways. Let me explain.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="health--lifestyle">Health &amp;amp; Lifestyle&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>I remember the first week I started working I looked around at my peers and asked myself: “what health problems do I need to worry about?”. There were a few that jumped out to me: bad posture, weight, eye strain – all related to a sedentary life in front of a computer. But there were a few more problems lurking beneath: sun deficiency, stress eating, and caffeine overconsumption.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A lot of developers offset this with a “min-max” lifestyle, where they stay really active and productive outside of work to offset the inactiveness of their job. This felt like a poor way to live my life. Youtuber KRAZAM has an amazing video satirizing this mentality.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I concluded that humans were not designed to sit in front of a computer and this job would slowly deteriorate my health if I didn’t change something.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="the-bubble">The Bubble&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>The tech bubble is real.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I think a large part of this is due to the “sameness” of software developers. Slightly nerdy, probably into video games, smart but a little socially awkward. Attire consists of t-shirt, jeans, and hoodie everyday. With this group of people you talk about the same things day in and day out at lunch.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Don’t get me wrong, I probably match a lot of these descriptions. And it’s not an assault on anyone in particular. But I disliked being surrounded by it. every. day. It weared on me.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I wanted to be more well rounded in my interests and relationships.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="entitlement">Entitlement&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>In the US, if you land an entry level software development gig, you are most likely in the top 5% of income earners in the US. That’s such a crazy statistic to me. What an incredible privilege: great job prospects, steady income, top of the line perks and benefits, good work-life balance. Good software developers are in such a demand right now that companies are throwing everything they can at them to attract talent.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This breeds a certain amount of entitlement amongst software devs in the industry.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Much like my rant with teachers and construction workers above, on a moral level it just didn’t sit right with me. I don’t really add that much value to society, yet society values me so much. Teachers can hardly pay for their class supplies while I’m doing code reviews from my bed at well over $100 an hour. It’s mind boggling.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Since the sky’s the limit in the tech world, many software developers keep wanting more and more. You’re already a top earner with top benefits, yet you’re disappointed that your new offer only offered to increase your salary by $40k? That’s more than the median salary in the US!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I concluded that there exists a certain entitlement in the tech industry that I needed to step away from. It was suffocating. I needed to come back to earth.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="-because-i-could">&amp;hellip; because I could.&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>This was probably the most compelling reason for me to quit my job. I had no family to support. No mortgage with my name on it. No debt. My biggest finances in life were my rent and my car. I had worked for six years straight, lived a very modest life, and been smart with my money.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Simply put, I knew if I closed my laptop and walked out the door I was in a life position where… I could.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But I was ensnared by the golden handcuffs of tech and bewitched by the sirens of upper management. I was told I was in the thick of my career and stepping away now would hurt my chances at “that promotion lurking in the future”. My friends were all steadily in their careers and here I was thinking of leaving it all. What would they think? What would my parents think?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This was a supremely difficult mental hurdle for me to conquer.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here’s what broke me out of it:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>~ I might not get another chance to do this again. ~&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I was 28 years old. I was at an all-time obligation low. I was healthy. I was financially stable. If there was ever a time to quit my job and explore a different life, now was it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And after six years I knew I owed it to myself to do it.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="so-what-now">So what now?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>It’s taken me about two months, on and off, to write this post. Much longer than I had expected.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I don’t have any profound thoughts to share yet, other than I’ve been really happy leaving my job and spending my time how I want to. Mostly I have been traveling and exploring a more down-to-earth lifestyle. I feel more alive in the past months than I have in years.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I’ve been reading a lot; mostly self-help literature on finding meaning in work and life. They’ve helped me understand and cope with my decision to leave work, as well as better understand what it is I am searching for.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As I’m making the last edits here, I’m sitting in the dining room of a beautiful craftsman home in rural California owned by a lovely elderly couple I am volunteering for. It’s quite a unique and awesome experience I’ve found myself in. My next blog post will go in depth in this.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I’m hoping this post will resonate with some individual out there. To those individuals, I’d like to direct to you a poignant thought from the venerable Uncle Iroh:&lt;/p>

&lt;p>My name is &lt;strong>Nico&lt;/strong> and let me be the first to welcome you to my new website, &lt;strong>NICO • PICO&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I’m a software developer who recently stepped away from his high-paying job to travel, pursue some passion projects, and live life. I plan on writing a lot about my feelings and learnings on this in my future blog posts.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="idea-origins">Idea Origins&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The idea of &lt;strong>NICO • PICO&lt;/strong> came to me after reaching out to a friend of mine who I hadn’t seen in a while. I asked if he wanted to join my girlfriend and me on a day trip to go pumpkin picking with the intent of catching up. He responded he didn’t have an interest in going as he was busy focusing on a new personal project of his — writing. He also conveyed that he was re-prioritizing his time and activities to achieve certain goals he had; and spending a valuable weekend day going pumpkin picking didn’t fit with that.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Something about our discussion was very inspiring and made me realize how writing can be a therapeutic vector to collect, focus, and share ideas. In the past I’ve toyed with maintaining a journal for some personal reflection, but close friends gave me feedback that my musings might prove helpful to someone else out there. I also like the idea of contributing back to the internet in a meaningful way. With that, &lt;strong>NICO • PICO&lt;/strong> was born!&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="hello-world">Hello World!&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I’d like to use this platform to:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Distill why I left my software development job&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Discuss my feelings on tech, lifestyle, photography, and culture&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Share some useful advice I’ve gathered along the way&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>I hope you, dear reader, find some information on this website inspiring and insightful. Expect more content weekly; and welcome to &lt;strong>NICO • PICO&lt;/strong>!&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
